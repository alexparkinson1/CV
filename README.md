## Alexandra Parkinson

I'm Alexandra but feel free to call me Alex! What I lack in experience I more than make up for in enthusiasm. I have a passion for code, design and reading a lot of books (Seriously, I read the twilight saga in 4 days, how embarrassing). To be able to work in an enviroment where I can improve my skills in code and design would be ideal. I heavily enjoy working in teams in a friendly, learning enviroment.

## Skills

#### Design

Art and Design has always been an interest of mine since childhood and in the world of web development I think I use this skill well in webpage layouts and logos.

I also spent a couple of weeks at Central St Martins University doing courses in fashion desgin and theatre design (which includes costume design and layout of the stage). I am always interested in finding ways to improve my skills, and explore new potential interests.

#### Communications and working in teams

My friendly and open nature helps me to build good connections with people and I feel fulfilled working in a team.

- I worked with customers and in groups of fellow employees during my job in retail. Keeping the team attitude going, helping us to achieve what was wanted of us and more.
- While working in groups during projects at Makers Academy, I was the first person my teammates went to for help with design and was always keen to help debugg. But also I was the team member reminding everyone to stay focused but in high spirits, even in troublesome situations.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2015 to April 2015)

An intense 12 week web development course. Challenging yet immensely fun, I believe that I have gained the skills to begin my career as a junior developer and continue with my passion for code. We learnt how to programme using Object Orientated Design and Test Driven Development, also many technologies including:
- Sinatra, Datamapper, PostgreSQL
- APIs
- Git
- Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Angular.js
- Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Cucumber, Protractor

#### College

Struggling to find my niche, before discovering computer programming, I delved into many different A level subjects during my time in 6th form college, including Philosophy, English, Fine Art, Classical Civilisation, Chemistry and Biology.

## Experience

**Topman (October 2013 to December 2014)**  
*Sales Advisor*

##Hobbies and Interests

- I danced between the ages 5 to 16 and was graded in many forms of dance including, Ballet, Tap, Modern and Jazz.
- I enjoyed learning and being graded in singing, piano and flute.
- I also did examinations in solo acting and appeared in a few TV advertisements and films.
- I have had 11 different hair colours, irrelevant, but I think impressive.
