## Alexandra Parkinson

I have a passion for code, design and new, shiny tech. To be able to work in an environment where I will be learning every day, will be making really cool stuff and will be making valuable contributions to a project would be a dream come true. I'm looking to work with people who also share my passion for programming.

## Skills

#### Programming 

I love the feeling that when I write a line of code I'm creating something. I'm always interested in trying out/teaching myself new languages and really getting to know the ones I have lots of experience with.

My skill set includes:
 - Ruby, Ruby on rails
 - Javascript, jQuery
 - Golang
 - PHP
 - Angular.js
 - Node.js
 - Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Cucumber
 - Sinatra

#### Front end and responsive design

Although I really enjoy back end work and I am skilled in it, front end and design is special to me. I have always been interested in art and design, and working in front end allows me to combine that with my passion for writing code.
In a previous job I was involved in a redesign of one of the companies websites, which included making the site fully responsive.

I have worked with:
 - HTML, SCSS
 - Frameworks such as Bootstrap and Skeleton

#### Communication and working in teams

My friendly and open nature helps me to build good connections with people and I feel fulfilled working in a team.

- I worked with customers and in groups of fellow employees during my job in retail. Keeping the team attitude going, helping us to achieve what was wanted of us and more.
- While working in groups during projects at Makers Academy, I was the first person my teammates went to for help with design and was always keen to help debug. But also I was the team member reminding everyone to stay focused but in high spirits, even in troublesome situations.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2015 to April 2015)

An intense 12 week web development course. Challenging yet immensely fun, I believe that I have gained the skills to begin my career as a junior developer and continue with my passion for code.
I was taught how to work using, Object Oriented Design, pair programming and agile principles & practices.

#### College

Struggling to find my niche, before discovering computer programming, I delved into many different A level subjects during my time in 6th form college, including Philosophy, English, Fine Art, Classical Civilisation, Chemistry and Biology.
